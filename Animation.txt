	1. CSS animations
		a. Advantages over Javascript
			i. No javascript code
			ii. Less load on computer
				1) Smoother animations
			iii. Stop animations from running in browser tabs that arent visible
		b. @keyframes rule
			i. Keyframe lists
				1) Has a name
				2) Contains properties/values that become animated
			ii. Selectors
				1) From
					a) Beginning of animation
				2) To
					a) End 
			iii. Percentages can be used to specify keyframes
				1) 0% = from
				2) 100% = to
				3) 50%=halfway point
		c. Properties
			i. Animation-name
				1) Names keyframe list
			ii. Animation-duration
				1) Length in seconds or millisecons(ms)
				2) Must have a postive value
					a) Cannot be 0
			iii. Animation delay
				1) Delays it from starting immediately
		d. Example
			i. @keyframes changeColors { from {background-color:blue;} to{background-color: green;}}
				1) Animation-name: changeColors
				2) Animation-duration: 1s;
				3) Animation-delay: 2s;
			ii. Reverts to original style after animation is completed
	2. Timing, Iteration Count & Direction
		a. Animation-timing-function
			i. Speed between keyframes
			ii. Ease 
				1) Slow start, fast, slow end (default)
			iii. Linear
				1) Same speed all the way
			iv. Ease-in
				1) Slow start
			v. Ease-out
			vi. Ease-in-out
				1) Slow start, slow end
			vii. Cubic-bezier(n1, n2, etc)
				1) Specify numbers that control speed
		b. Animation-iteration-count
			i. # of times animation runs
			ii. Can be infinite as a value
		c. Animation direction
			i. Normal (ddefault)
			ii. Reverse
			iii. Alternate
			iv. Alternate-reverse
		d. Animation
			i. Shorthand that has:
				1) Name
				2) Duration
				3) Timing
				4) Delay
				5) Iteration
				6) Direction
			ii. Animation: move 3s linear 2s infinte normal
	3. Transitions
		a. Animates transition from one state to another
			i. Animate an element getting wider when width is increased
		b. Commonly used with ::hover to trigger mouse animation
		c. Execute when property values are changed unlike animations that are scheduled
		d. Less control over animations
		e. Defined by CSS properties and duration
		f. Transition-timing-function
			i. Speed of transition
			ii. Ease
			iii. Linear
			iv. Etc.
		g. Transition-delay
			i. Delays start
	4. Transform
		a. 2D or 3D transofrmation to an element
		b. Alters position, shape or orientation
		c. Translate(x,y)
			i. Moves element on x and y axis
		d. Scale(x,y)
			i. Increases width/height by x and y multiplier
		e. Rotate(angle)
			i. Rotates clockwise by angle
