	1. Design for different screen sizes
		a. Strategies
			i. Graceful degradation
				1) Desktop site first, then modify to fit smaller screens
			ii. Progressive enhancement
				1) Mobile first design
				2) Smallest device first then larger
				3) Best used for websites that show equal text and images for all platforms
	2. Media Queries
		a. Combo of media type and optionally one or more media features expressions that evaluate to true or fales
			i. Media type
				1) Device category that query applies to
					a) All
						i) All devices
						ii) default
					b) Print
						i) Documents viewed on screen in print preview mode
					c) Screen
						i) Intended for screens
			ii. Media feature
				1) Characteristic of brwoser deivce or environment
				2) Some can be fixed with min/max 
					a) Min-width: 200px
						i) Width must be > or = 200px
					b) Aspect ratio
						i) Width to height ratio
					c) Height of viewport
					d) Width
					e) Orientation
						i) Portrait / landscaoe
					f) Resolution
						i) Pixel density
		b. Often used in link elements and in stylesheets
			i. The link element defines a media query with media attributes
				1) <link rel="stylesheet" media="print and (min-width: 400px)">
					a) Is the webpage being printed and is the viewport > 400px?????
						i) If just viewing on a device, print = false and no style sheet is downloaded
				2) When media query matches, style sheet is downloaded and applied
			ii. @media at-rule
				1) Instructs CSS how to behave
		c. A media query essentially poses a question, and if the HTMl matches the question, it becomes that CSS style
	3. Breakpoints
		a. Determine when content should be displayed, resized, or hidden in a page
		b. Screen width that activates a media query
			i. @media screen (max-width: 800px);
				1) 800 is breakpoint
		c. Good practice to target content rather than device type with breakpoints
		d. Don't work unless the meta element sets the viewport width to device width
			i. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">
			
		
				
			
Media Query Code Example:




@media (min-width: 600px) {
   .benefits-container {
      flex-direction: row;
   }
}
@media (min-width: 700px) {
   nav li {
      display: inline;
   }
   header > h1 {
      font-size: 3rem;
   }
}
@media (min-width: 800px) {
   .vacation-container img {
      width: 50vw;
   }
   .vacation-container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
   }
   .vacation-container > div {
      margin: 20px;
   }
}
