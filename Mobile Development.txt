	1. Mobile Web Browsers
		a. Designed for smartphones
		b. Uses same languages as web browsers such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript
	2. Designing
		a. Smaller screen size
		b. Touch interface 
		c. Limited/slower connectivity
		d. Data plans
			i. Content downloading
		e. Different purpose
		f. Limited memory / speed
		g. GPS data
	3. Implementing
		a. Separate websites
			i. One for desktop one for mobile
		b. Dynamic serving
			i. Same URL 
				1) Desktop version for desktop
				2) Mobile for mobile
			ii. Server Identifies if HTTP request for URL came from mobile or desktop
				1) Sends back mobile or desktop site
			iii. Server uses User-Agent code to determine if mobile or desktop
				1) User-Agent: Chrome (iphone)
	4. Responsive web design (RWD)
		a. Altering appearance based on device size
		b. Characteristics
			i. Elements laid out on proportion-based grids that use relative units
				1) Percentages instead of pixels
			ii. Images sized with relative units to adapt to screen sizes
			iii. CSS media queries apply different CSS styles
				1) Based on browser width
		c. Allows for creating a single page that adapts to mobile, desktop and tablet browsers
	
	
	1. Screen Emulators
		a. A desktop tool that aids in mobile design without a mobile device
		b. Simulates how mobile device screens operate
			i. Built in to Chrome and Edge
				1) Ctrl + shift + I
					a) Windows access 
		c. Mouse pointer appears as a circle to simulate a finger
		d. Can select drop down at top to switch between device types
			i. Iphone 14
			ii. Galaxy S22
			iii. Etc.
	2. Pixel Ratio
		a. DPR
			i. Device pixel ratio
			ii. Ratio between device and logical pixels
			iii. DPR of 2
				1) 1 logical is 2 device pixels wide, 2 device pixels tall, 4 pixels altogether
				2) <div style="width:20px">
					a) Makes div 20px wide
			iv. Four logical pixels are 4 device pixels on a device with a DPR of 1, 16 with a DPR of 2, 36 with a DPR of 3
			v. 2DPR is double width and height of 1DPR pixels
		b. DPR Math
			i. 1DPR = 1 x 1
				1) 50 x 50 pixels = 50 x 50 = 2,500 total pixels
			ii. 2DPR = 2 x 2 = 4 
				1) 50 x 50 pixels = 50 x 50 x 4 = 10,000 total pixels
			iii. 3DRP = 3 x 3 = 9 
				1) 50 x 50 pixels = 50 x 50 x 9 = 22,500 total pixels
		c. Logical pixel
			i. Device independent pixel (DIP)
			ii. CSS px for example
		d. Screens normally built with DPR
	3. Emulating Network Conditions
		a. Pressing ESC in DevTools shows network conditions and sensors tabs
		b. Allow for modifying:
			i. Caching
				1) Disable to redownload content every time
			ii. Network throttling
				1) Simulate 2 or 3g networks
				2) Slower networks
			iii. User agent
				1) Any number of browser user agents
	4. Emulating Sensors
		a. Most desktops donâ€™t have touch, GPS, or accelerometers
		b. Emulate snesors using dev tools
	5. Viewport
		a. Visible area of page
		b. Does not include address bar/toolbar
		c. Viewport meta element
			i. Properties that affect what the viewport displays
				1) Width
					a) Device-width
				2) Initial-scale
					a) Initial zoom level
					b) Default is 1 for 100% zoom
				3) User-scalable
					a) Boolean
					b) No = prevents zooming
	6. Viewport Units
		a. Vw and vh 
			i. Percentage of viewports width or heigh
				1) 1vw = 1% width
				2) 1vh = 1% height
		b. Vmin and vmax
		c. Using just a % without vw or vh would be a % of the parents width
			i. Viewport = 400px
			ii. <div width=300px>
				1) <div width="50vw"</div> = 50% of viewport = 200px
				2) <div width=50%</div> = 50% of parent width = 150px
		d. Overflow: auto;
			i. Allows text size to be changed to fit in viewport and adds a scroll bar
		e. Width larger than webpage
			i. 120vw for example
				1) Renders a horizontal scroll bar
